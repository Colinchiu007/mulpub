## Overview

Cohere's current web presence feels like a sober enterprise AI command center with editorial restraint. The home page opens on a huge typographic declaration over a white canvas, then uses photography, dark product mockups, trust logos, and generous empty space to make AI infrastructure feel controlled rather than speculative. Product pages invert the tone into deep green-black or dark navy bands, while blog and research pages move toward publishing-system clarity: large filters, thin rules, dense lists, and pale technical backgrounds.

What makes the system distinctive is the mix of austere black-and-white UI with bursts of tactile brand imagery. The site avoids decorative chrome in the normal interface; color arrives through photography, abstract 3D media, coral blog taxonomy chips, blue research links, and dark product environments. Cards are rounded but not cute. Type is large, tight, and almost monospaced in spirit, creating a research-lab cadence across marketing, product, and editorial surfaces.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Monumental display headlines with very tight line height and negative tracking.
- White editorial canvases interrupted by deep green, dark navy, and image-led CTA bands.
- Rounded media cards and product cards, usually 8px to 22px.
- Pill CTAs in near-black or white, with most secondary actions rendered as underlined text links.
- Trust-logo strips with monochrome partner marks and very wide vertical spacing.
- Agent-console mockups using dark panels, small status chips, and product integration badges.
- Blog and research surfaces with prominent taxonomy chips, long rule-separated lists, and search fields.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent

- **Cohere Black** (`#000000`): Announcement bar, highest-contrast text, and the global brand anchor.
- **Near-Black Primary** (`#17171c`): Primary CTA buttons, dark footer, and deep UI cards.
- **Deep Enterprise Green** (`#003c33`): Product hero bands for North and Command-style dark sections.
- **Dark Navy** (`#071829`): Financial-services and security-oriented solution bands.
- **Action Blue** (`#1863dc`): Editorial links, pagination, and secondary action emphasis.
- **Coral** (`#ff7759`): Blog category chips, taxonomy outlines, and warm product markers.
- **Soft Coral** (`#ffad9b`): Pale chip borders and segmented article-label details.

### Surface & Background

- **Canvas White** (`#ffffff`): Dominant page background and form/card surface.
- **Soft Stone** (`#eeece7`): Product cards, testimonial placeholders, and warm neutral surface blocks.
- **Pale Green Wash** (`#edfce9`): North page section backdrop behind stacked dark capability panels.
- **Pale Blue Wash** (`#f1f5ff`): Blog CTA surface behind abstract 3D imagery.
- **Card Border** (`#f2f2f2`): Softest card containment line.

### Text & Rules

- **Ink** (`#212121`): Default body text and most link text on light backgrounds.
- **Muted Slate** (`#93939f`): Footer links, dates, metadata, and de-emphasized labels.
- **Slate** (`#75758a`): Research separators and tertiary text.
- **Hairline** (`#d9d9dd`): Standard list rules and section dividers.
- **Border Light** (`#e5e7eb`): Secondary divider and utility rule.

### Semantic

- **Focus Blue** (`#4c6ee6`): Keyboard focus and ring color.
- **Form Focus Violet** (`#9b60aa`): Focus border for text inputs.
- **Error Red** (`#b30000`): Extracted ring/shadow color associated with validation-like states.

### Gradient System

Cohere does not use gradients as a generic UI fill. Gradients and color fields are media-led: abstract 3D hero imagery, deep blue open-science particle fields, red-orange product video posters, and dark green-to-black product environments. Keep UI surfaces flat; reserve gradient richness for large media panels and CTA image bands.

## Typography

### Font Family

- **Display**: `CohereText`, falling back to `Space Grotesk`, `Inter`, `ui-sans-serif`, and `system-ui`.
- **Body/UI**: `Unica77 Cohere Web`, falling back to `Inter`, `Arial`, `ui-sans-serif`, and `system-ui`.
- **Technical labels**: `CohereMono`, falling back to `Arial`, `ui-sans-serif`, and `system-ui`.
- **Icons**: Cohere uses custom icon fonts and thin-line geometric illustrations.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Hero Display | CohereText | 96px | 400 | 1.00 | -1.92px | Home page declaration scale. |
| Product Display | CohereText | 72px | 400 | 1.00 | -1.44px | Product and research hero headlines. |
| Section Display | Unica77 | 60px | 400 | 1.00 | -1.2px | Large product-page headings. |
| Section Heading | Unica77 | 48px | 400 | 1.20 | -0.48px | Split hero and CTA headings. |
| Card Heading | Unica77 | 32px | 400 | 1.20 | -0.32px | Feature card and list section titles. |

| Button | Unica77 | 14px | 500 | 1.71 | 0 | Compact CTA labels. |
| Caption | Unica77 | 14px | 400 | 1.40 | 0 | Metadata and small explanatory text. |
| Mono Label | CohereMono | 14px | 400 | 1.40 | 0.28px | Uppercase technical labels. |
| Micro | Unica77 | 12px | 400 | 1.40 | 0 | Footer, nav microcopy, and small links. |

### Principles

- Use massive type sparingly; Cohere pages often have one oversized headline and then settle into restrained 16px-24px UI copy.
- Keep display type tight. Hero copy should feel compact and carved, not airy.
- Avoid heavy bold weights. Size, spacing, and surface contrast do most of the hierarchy work.
- Use uppercase mono labels for category and system markers, especially on product and research pages.
- Editorial pages can use coral chips and blue links, but the base typography remains black and measured.

## Layout

### Spacing System

The system uses an 8px base with many one-off alignment values: `2px`, `6px`, `8px`, `10px`, `12px`, `16px`, `20px`, `22px`, `24px`, `28px`, `32px`, `36px`, `40px`, `56px`, `60px`, `64px`, and `80px`.

Large sections rely on dramatic vertical breathing room. The home page places a trust-logo strip far below the hero media. Product pages often hold dark panels inside fields of empty white space, then transition to dense forms or footers only near the end.

### Grid & Container

- Global nav uses a three-zone layout: logo left, menu centered, sign-in/CTA right.
- Home hero is centered text above a two-card media composition: a wide product mockup card beside a narrower photography card.
- Feature sections commonly use 3-column cards on desktop.
- Product pages alternate centered hero blocks, trust-logo strips, large single-feature bands, and 2- or 3-column card grids.
- Research pages use full-width lists with date and chip columns instead of decorative cards.
- Forms use two-column input rows inside a rounded white card on dark or stone section backgrounds.

### Whitespace Philosophy

Cohere uses whitespace as a trust signal. Large empty intervals separate the brand claim, customer proof, product proof, and CTA. Dense content appears only where it serves the information architecture: research paper rows, blog card grids, and contact form fields.

## Elevation & Depth

Cohere is mostly flat. Depth comes from surface alternation, media contrast, rounded corners, and thin borders rather than drop shadows.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Flat | No shadow, white or dark field | Hero copy, research lists, editorial surfaces |
| Bordered | 1px `#d9d9dd`, `#e5e7eb`, or dark translucent rules | Research rows, forms, pale cards, footer inputs |
| Media Lift | Rounded image or video over contrasting section color | Hero photo cards, product videos, CTA imagery |
| Dark Product Field | Deep green or navy full-width band | Command, North, financial services, security sections |

## Shapes

### Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---:|---|
| `xs` | 4px | Small images, search fields, article thumbnails, utility elements |
| `sm` | 8px | Blog chips, cards, small media, dialogs |
| `md` | 16px | Medium product cards and grouped blocks |
| `lg` | 22px | Signature media-card and soft placeholder radius |
| `xl` | 30px | Research/topic filter pills |
| `pill` | 32px | Primary CTA buttons |
| `full` | 9999px | Round status elements and fully pill-shaped controls |

### Image Treatment

Images are not decorative backdrops for text except in CTA bands. Most imagery sits as rounded cards with visible corners: product videos, enterprise photography, article thumbnails, and abstract 3D renders. The dominant radii are 8px and 22px.

## Components

### **`button-primary`**

Near-black or white pill CTA, depending on surface contrast. Uses 14px-16px Unica77, 12px 24px padding, and a 32px pill radius. This is the primary action style for "Request a demo", "Submit", and hero CTAs.

### **`button-secondary`**

Text-only action link, usually underlined or rule-aligned, with no filled background. Used for "Explore products", "Try the Playground", newsletter signup, and secondary hero actions.

### **`button-pill-outline`**

Outlined pill control with transparent fill, 1px dark border, and 30px radius. Used for research filters, topic tags, and lightweight taxonomy controls.

### **`announcement-bar`**

Full-width black strip above the nav, 36px tall, centered microcopy with an underlined "Learn more" link and a close control at the far right.

### **`hero-photo-card`**

Rounded media card used in the home hero and solution pages. It combines photography or abstract imagery with an overlaid dark agent-console module. Radius is usually 22px on large cards and 8px on smaller thumbnails.

### **`agent-console-card`**

Dark product mockup panel showing agent names, status chips, integration badges, prompt fields, and generated response cards. Background is near-black, text is white or muted, and small accent chips use product colors.

### **`trust-logo-strip`**

Centered copy above a row of monochrome customer logos. It is intentionally quiet: no cards, no borders, just large horizontal spacing and black or white logos depending on the background.

### **`capability-card`**

Content block with thin-line geometric illustration, 24px heading, body copy, and a text link. On light backgrounds, cards often have only a top rule or a subtle image/card relationship rather than full boxing.

### **`dark-feature-band`**

Deep green or navy full-width section used for product capabilities, security claims, and feature breakdowns. Text turns white; cards use darker translucent surfaces, pale borders, and abstract line illustrations.

### **`product-card`**

Warm stone card used for product/model summaries. Typically 3-column on desktop, with 8px radius, generous padding, a small pill button, a divider line, and checkmark bullet rows.

### **`blog-filter-chip`**

Large coral taxonomy chip used on the blog index. Active chips invert to coral fill with dark text; inactive chips use coral outline and pale fill. Typography is oversized relative to typical filters, making the taxonomy a hero-level control.

### **`research-table`**

Rule-separated publication list with title left, topic pills centered, and date right. Rows are tall, white, and border-driven; filters above use many compact outlined pills.

### **`contact-form-card`**

Rounded white form panel set against dark green or warm stone sections. Inputs are rectangular with thin gray borders, 12px-16px padding, and compact labels/placeholders. Submit uses the same near-black pill style as primary CTAs.

### **`footer-newsletter`**

Dark footer subscription block with coral "AI moves fast" label, white headline, muted legal microcopy, a single-line email field, and arrow submit marker. Footer columns use white section labels and muted links.

## Copy & Microcopy（交互文案分册，2026-08-12）

交互文案（提示/错误/警告/建议/状态/引导）与视觉 token 同等重要。完整规范见 `01-docs/PROMPT-TEXT-SPEC.md`（唯一事实源：`src/utils/user-facing-error.js`）。

### 写作原则

1. **自然语言**：像人说话，不用内部标识符（IPC 通道名、英文错误码、栈信息、IP:端口、英文括号注释）。
2. **原因 + 建议**：失败提示必须同时给「具体原因」和「解决方法建议」。
   - ❌ 「当前许可证无权访问 store:list-publish-history」
   - ✅ 「当前未登录或登录状态已失效，无法使用该功能。请先登录后重试；若仍提示无权限，请确认当前账号已开通所需权益。」
3. **具体 > 笼统**：优先保留业务原因（「排期失败：任务不存在」），不无脑替换为「操作失败」。
4. **多语言**：zh/en 成对提供；语言解析 = 用户显式设置 > 系统语言（`zh*`→zh、`en*`→en、其余→en）> 默认 zh；设置弹窗「通用设置」可切换。
5. **语气**：礼貌、克制、无责备；错误不 panic，给可执行的下一步。

### 四类文案口径

| 类型 | 要求 | 示例（zh） |
|------|------|-----------|
| 错误 | 原因 + 建议 | 「网络连接失败。请检查网络后重试。」 |
| 警告 | 风险 + 选择 | 「操作过于频繁，已被服务商限流。请稍等片刻后再试。」 |
| 成功/状态 | 结果 + 下一步（可选） | 「已复制视频文件位置。」 |
| 引导 | 目的 + 操作 | 「请在「模型设置」中填写对应服务商的 API Key 后重试。」 |

### 渲染约束

- 用户可见区域禁止直接渲染 `result.message` / `e.message` 原文，必须经 `formatUserError()`。
- 主进程 `message` 不得包含内部通道名；诊断信息放 `messageParams.channel` / `messageParams.detail`。
- Story2Video 通知沿用 pattern→key 映射（保留「当前许可证无权访问」「当前账号没有所需权益」前缀兼容）。

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Use white canvas as the default surface; introduce dark green or navy as full-width product bands.
- Keep primary CTAs pill-shaped and near-black on light surfaces.
- Use 22px radius on major media cards and placeholders.
- Use coral for editorial taxonomy and small warm accents, not as the main CTA system.
- Use monochrome trust logos with wide spacing.
- Use thin-line geometric illustrations for research and capability icons.
- Let photography and product mockups carry color, while the UI shell stays restrained.

### Don't

- Do not turn coral or blue into broad decorative surface colors.
- Do not add heavy drop shadows to cards.
- Do not make every section card-based; Cohere often uses unframed rows, rules, and open space.
- Do not use rounded cards below 8px for major media.
- Do not replace the display/body type split with one generic sans-serif voice.
- Do not render undocumented interaction variants in documentation or previews.
- Do not use saturated gradients as normal UI backgrounds; keep gradients media-led.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---:|---|
| Small Mobile | <425px | Single-column cards, compact nav, reduced hero headline scale |
| Mobile | 425-640px | Hero media stacks, card grids become one column, form rows stack |
| Large Mobile | 640-768px | Wider one-column layouts with larger media cards |
| Tablet | 768-1024px | Two-column cards begin, nav spacing tightens |
| Desktop | 1024-1440px | Full nav, 3-column card grids, split hero compositions |
| Large Desktop | 1440-2560px | Wide containers and large empty vertical intervals |

### Touch Targets

Primary CTAs and pills meet comfortable touch sizing through 12px-24px padding and pill radii. Research filter chips and blog category chips are larger than standard tags, making dense taxonomy surfaces usable on touch devices.

### Collapsing Strategy

- Nav collapses from full horizontal links to a compact mobile menu.
- Hero media moves from split cards to stacked cards.
- Product and capability grids collapse from 3 columns to 2 and then 1.
- Form fields collapse from paired rows to a single column.
- Research rows preserve their rule-separated structure but stack metadata below titles on smaller widths.

## Iteration Guide

1. Start from a white canvas or a full-width dark green/navy band; avoid mid-tone page backgrounds unless the screenshot shows a specific CTA/form section.
2. Use `button-primary` for the single highest-priority action and `button-secondary` for the companion action.
3. Use `hero-photo-card` or `agent-console-card` when a page needs visual energy; avoid invented dashboard data.
4. For editorial pages, combine `blog-filter-chip`, `button-pill-outline`, and `research-table` instead of generic marketing cards.
5. Keep component examples structurally honest: placeholder product frames are better than invented product content.

## 视频流水线进度弹窗（2026-08-23）

### 结构与层级

- 进度弹窗是运行详情的唯一完整承载，不在启动页正文重复渲染 StageProgress。统一使用 `UiModal variant=progress`、`xl`、`960px` 最大宽度。
- 桌面 overlay 的 z-index 为 100，固定底部 action bar 为 110；overlay 保持视觉遮罩但不拦截 action bar，弹窗 surface 与 body 内容仍可交互。
- header/footer 固定，body 使用 `overflow-y: auto`；最大高度减去 `88px` action-bar 空间和安全边距，窄屏按 `136px` 移动 action-bar 空间计算。

### 交互与动效

- 进度弹窗是 modeless 观察窗：遮罩点击和 Escape 不关闭，只有右上角关闭按钮可触发 detach。关闭按钮带可访问 label 和稳定 test id。
- 离场使用 opacity + `scale(0.96) translateY(4px)`，让用户明确看到观察窗被收起，而不是任务被取消。
- **footer 四按钮契约（2026-10-17）**：所有视频流水线进度浮层（视频创作页与热门选题页）footer 从左到右固定为 **【查看】【去发布】【后台运行】【取消】**，且一律用 `UiButton` 渲染（`secondary` 变体；重试用 `primary`）。任何页面 SHALL NOT 在 footer 用小节私有按钮类（如 `cohere-btn-*`）承载流水线动作 —— 与弹窗内 `StageProgress` 同源，保证圆角、内边距、禁用态、主次色一致。
- 【查看】【去发布】在任何状态都渲染，但初始 `disabled` + `aria-disabled="true"` 并保留可见文案（不用 tooltip 替代）；仅本次 run `completed` 且取得成片后转为可点。
- 运行中 footer 提供【后台运行】；右上角关闭和该按钮走同一 detach handler。toast 为“任务已转入后台运行，在历史记录中可查看”。
- 终态（`completed`）后【后台运行】【取消】不再渲染（无运行中任务可脱离/可取消），由右上角关闭承接收起；关闭动作改为复位前端态并收起浮层，不调用 `pipelineCancel`。
- 人工 checkpoint（素材选择/内容策略/等待用户输入）关闭按钮 disabled，footer 不显示后台按钮，保留确认、修改、取消动作；【查看】【去发布】此时保持灰显。
- footer 中的长文案（错误提示、人工检查点提示）以 `flex: 1` / `margin-right: auto` 占位在左，按钮组靠右，避免错误文字被挤到按钮之间。

### 内容与数据表现

总进度、已用时、终态摘要、所有阶段、状态、详情、阶段耗时、子进度、合成时间参考、provider warning、BGM 跳过、加载/不可用提示和素材选择面板都属于弹窗内容。数组、对象和进度范围先归一化，错误字段只隐藏或走既有 fallback，不使 renderer 崩溃。

**完成态即决策中枢（2026-10-17）**：run 成功后弹窗**保持打开**，内容区定格为「阶段全完成 + 进度 100% + 完成汇总」，footer 的【查看】【去发布】同帧解锁。不再自动跳转结果页 —— 成功瞬间用户要的是"下一步做什么"，而不是被动离开当前上下文。

### 范围边界与废弃组件

该统一壳只覆盖编排流水线、历史续跑等“有可观察流水线阶段状态”的路径；快速渲染 loading、发布 timeline、独立分析状态保持各自轻量展示。已废弃的 `CreateHistory.vue` 不再提供内嵌进度卡片，历史入口统一为 `CreateViewHistory.vue` 的摘要与恢复。

## Known Gaps

- Exact proprietary font files are not bundled; use the documented fallbacks when implementing externally.
- Mobile screenshots were not regenerated in this public update, so mobile behavior is documented from the desktop system and existing responsive patterns.
- Some live pages lazy-load content blocks late; blank testimonial placeholders are documented as placeholder skeleton surfaces rather than filled testimonial cards.
